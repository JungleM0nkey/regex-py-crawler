**WHAT IT DOES.**

Will look through all files and folders starting with the root directory which you have assigned.<br />
Parses: .doc .docx .xls .xlsx .pdf .msg .txt<br />
Outputs: .txt file with a list of all found files, aswell as the line number of the regex match and the match itself.

**HOW TO.**

0. Install the required libraries, I highly recommend to do this on linux.
1. Assign the root directory to the **path** variable
2. Assign the output file location to the **output_path** variable
3. Assign the regular expression to the **PATTERN1** variable
4. Run using python3
